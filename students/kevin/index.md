### About Me

As the founder of SEI \(Silent Evidence Initiative\) Theater, I develop custom software and hardware systems to create mobile, immersive theatrical experiences.  The experiences frequently focus on the issue Silent Evidence, a term coined by Nassim Nicholas Taleb in his book The Black Swan, or the information which due to its absence for numerous reasons, falsly shapes our world views.  Past works have been presented at The Brick Theater Company in NYC, The National Conference of the Alliance for the Arts in Research Universities, and been funded by the Frank-Ratchye Fund for Art @ the Frontier and The Henry Armero Memorial Grant for Inclusive Creativity.
