#### Concept

My inspiration for this project came directly from [*Citius, Altius, Fortius*](https://vimeo.com/100576137) by Felix Deimann and [*Forms*](http://www.quayola.com/forms/) by Memo Atken and Quayola, who used Olympics footage to create some elegant, abstract animations. I wanted to make similar abstractions by using motion capture data and automating some of the animation using scripts in Maya. In addition, I wanted to work with two actors in order to create a collision of forces within the abstraction.

The reason I called this project *Synergy* is because, halfway through my process, I was able to partner up with Irene and Charlotte for some Optitrack/Kinect action. The partnership was essential since we split up all the testing and capturing amongst the three of us. It was trully technical, but we are a capable team. In addition, working with actors and dancers was stupendous because of their positive attitude and the awareness they had of their own bodies.

#### Process

Our process was incredibly, incredibly technical. Here is a breakdown.

*3D Scan*
- 3D scan the subject using **123D Catch** for the iPad
- Reduce and clean the geometry using **Maya** and the **DynaMesh** feature in **ZBrush**

*Generate Forms with Maya*
- Generate new renditions of our piggy using **MEL scripting in Maya**
- Format their pivots and export the OBJs for **Unity**

*Implement Interactions in Unity*
- Implement touch interactions with 3D objects, including rotation and spawning
- Adjust the standard shader to give the right appearance
- Use the **Unity Remote** to debug the program in real time

*Build on iOS*
- Deploy the Unity build for an iPad 4 using **XCode7**, which thankfully allows developers to build on devices for free starting this year

*Construct the Pyramid*
- Calculate proportions of pyramid
- Laser cut on clear acrylic (prototype) and black-tinted acrylic
- Assemble with acrylic cement

*Other*
- Document the project in semi-dark settings
- Use the **Flicker Free** plugin for **Premiere Pro** because it's hard to record screens in the dark
