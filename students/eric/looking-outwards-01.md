*Gravity Ghost* is a physics based puzzle game created by Ivy Games, founded by Erin Robinson Swink in 2010.  In this game, one plays as the ghost of a child who floats through space and must reunite the spirits of animals with their bones and terraform planets with their hair.  It sounds very strange, but the story behind all this is very compelling and revealed through cut scenes triggered through various events.  This is, to me, part of the charm to it; everything is very abstract but aesthetically beautiful. I’m not sure why everything was happening, but I can really get the emotion from the music, art style, and dialogue, which creates a very relaxing yet thought provoking adventure.  The gameplay and art are very simplistic, yet they are able to convey so much meaning, especially as the story goes along; as she tumbles through space, though she may meet something there is still that feeling of isolation.  This is what inspired me about it; the game looks like it was drawn in crayon but it has many layers of depth within it.

According to the article, Erin Robinson Swink wanted to create a game that felt rewarding but didn’t revolve around violence, which are common to many games nowadays.  She also wanted to depict a child’s view of the afterlife, hence the unique art style and storytelling.  Given these goals, her studio did a remarkable job.  The premise itself is novel; there are not many games where one plays as a ghost of a teenage girl who has to use her hair to solve puzzles.  Depicting the child’s view of the afterlife was also very successful; the aesthetic and simplicity seemed very child-like, and since they focused a lot on colors you get very vivid imagery which bring the world to life.  Gameplay wise *Gravity Ghost* excels in gravity based physics, which goes hand in hand with the themes, giving the game a sort of floatiness which seems appropriate to the game’s parallels to the afterlife and loneliness.  In addition to the way it tells its story through sparse cut scenes given at certain times, the feeling of isolation and mystery is amazingly represented.  The atmosphere, gameplay, and unique story all make Gravity Ghost a game like no other.

The main driving force behind the production of this game was that Erin wanted to make a game where violence and failure did not drive the gameplay.  On the game’s website, she mentions how “*Gravity Ghost* is a game to soothe your senses.  There’s no killing.  No dying, No way to fail.  Just hours of blissing out to buttery-smooth gravity goodness.”  Instead, since she has a background in experimental psychology (interested in the intersection between neuroscience and video games, she used to work as a research assistant in a neuroscience lab), she focused on how to make a game feel rewarding without killing something.  There’s no way to fail, and also due to her background in psychology much of the game focuses on the fear of death and tragedy, which is tied with the sense of loneliness felt in the game and unconventional story.  The game was actually conceptualized through her view that the world is tiny, and from various sketches to a test in the Unity software she took out the health, lives, enemies, and death and placed her characters in a large lonely world.  If there was any inspiration, it was her background in psychology in addition to all of the games which she felt were based on rewarding kills.
