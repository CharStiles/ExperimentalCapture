# Making Love: Poetry in Motion
##Looking Outwards 9/23

###Overview
[Making Love: Poetry in Motion](http://turbulence.org/commissions/PoetryInMotion/) is a crowd-sourced poem about love. Using real time tweets, the reader’s computer generates an endless poem about love that is unique to that computer. 


###My Thoughts
I found this project interesting because of it examines the interplay between something very old (the concept of love) and something very new (social media). I have always felt that in today's society social media is over whelming and chaotic. Many use the internet to shout their own life and emotions, with little time of care spent listening to someone else. Tweets (or posts) are rarely connected, unless by hashtag. Even then, the hashtag can have many different meanings based on context. (Examining the different uses of hashtags seems like it might be an interesting project, but that’s for another time.)
This project brings separate posts together into a stream of words and sound that creates the feeling of a unified subject, instead of simply a stream of narcissistic information about strangers. When I read about the project before viewing it, I thought it might show a unified society that, despite cultural differences, still fundamentally feels the same thing: love.

I was disappointed. Mostly by my own optimism.

Instead, within the first minute, I had a tweet that went along the lines of "@someone I love you follow me" followed by another that began "If you love levis you will love our new..."
Instead, I felt like this project showed how easily we use the word 'love' and that it's use no longer is connected to a strong fundamental human emotion. Maybe this is different in languages such as spanish, where 'te amo' and 'te quiero' both mean 'I love you', but have different strengths, but most of the tweets I saw were in english, and seemed to range from silly to vulgar. Perhaps this was meant as a rude awakening to how our society is changing, but I would have liked to see the world in a more positive light. Maybe this is why I'm not on Twitter in the first place.


###What I Would Change
I would really like to look at the 'semantic analysis algorithms' they use to determine if a tweet is about love or not. From what I could tell, if the tweet contained the word 'love' it was included. While this is a good way of examining our use of the word, it does not necessarily portray at how we feel the emotion. For example, I can say 'I love summer', but summer is a concept, something humans use to describe a point in time. Do I really love summer? Or do I love sunshine, ice cream and flowers? This algorithm also wouldn’t include something that doesn't explicitly state the word 'love'. I could say 'Every moment I spend with you is a gift, and I am truly blessed to have you in my life'. It doesn’t say it's about love, but is it? I think doing a deeper analysis of the tweets might provide stronger content. Admittedly, I do not know much about semantic analysis, so maybe this is much harder than I think it iw.

When researching the artists, OMTA, they were quoted as saying “We are not interested in a one sided relationship with the viewers where they remain passive, as viewers that pass by. In this age of information and technology the crowds are no longer passive, they are active participants”. While I can see how this project uses the tweets of the crowds, I felt that as a viewer I had no way of interacting with what I was experiencing. Although I could tweet things containing the word love, and hope the algorithm spit it onto my computer screen, I felt that I was very limited in my interactions. Ideally, I think it would be interesting if the participant could modify the algorithm deciding what is about love. This would also create another perspective of love, since it would show how people thought it should be defined. However, this could also become quite complicated, so I understand why it’s not currently an option.


### Influences
[OMTA (Omer and Tal Golan)](http://omta.co/about/) are new-media artists. "OMTA creates artistic displays that encourage viewer participation, in order to conduct studies regarding human interaction, digital mediation, body image, and social awareness." They have been influenced by the work of Rembrandt Van Rijn, Pablo Picasso, contemporary artists Mel Alexenberg, Aaron Koblin, and Daniel Rozin.

[Turbulence](http://turbulence.org/) commissioned the piece.  Turbulence is a project of New Radio and Performing Arts, Inc. and focuses on hybrid network art forms.
