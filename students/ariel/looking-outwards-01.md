### Looking Outwards 1: An App that Detects Boredom

Using research from over 40,000,000 usage logs and 4,398 boredom self-reports of 54 mobile phone users, Spain’s Telefonica Research has built an app that can detect boredom in mobile users and suggest a solution. The app, called Borapp, is still in its developmental stages but has so far shown 82% accuracy.

What I love about this app is that it explores not physical motion but digital motion. We get in the habit of thinking that the word “motion” refers only to physical motion and that “motion capture” refers only to capturing of physical motion. However, I’d like to challenge that notion. Since the world is becoming increasingly more technological, it is important to also consider one’s digital footprint as a measure of one’s motion. A lot can be said about a person through his or her digital footprint, so much so that we have even found a way to measure boredom through analyzing digital footprints.

And it’s not just boredom that we can measure. The idea of this app stemmed from the idea that our phones are recording so much data and not necessarily putting it to good use. If we find a way to harness and analyze all the data that passes through our phones, our phones could have a dramatic impact on our “productivity and personal well-being”.
