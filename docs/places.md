### Extreme Cameras

* [Trevor Paglen, in *Photographing Secret Sites and Satellites*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Igfu0VwdkQ) is "a guy who points his camera through astronomy telescopes at secret military sites to photography things that are off limits to the public." (*Show 0:00-3:30*)<br />![Paglen](http://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2015/03/example1.jpg)

* British artist Mishka Henner [has been gathering satellite images](http://hyperallergic.com/230003/the-surreal-beauty-of-feedlots-by-satellite/) of feedlots, or Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations. Ordinarily, photographing CAFOs is illegal due to "Ag-Gag" laws.<br />![Henner](http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Coronado-Feeders-Dalhart-Texas-2013.jpg)

* [Telestereoscope (Eyestilts) by Cassidy Curtis](http://eyestilts.com/images/scopebm_sunday.jpg)<br />![Eyestilts](http://eyestilts.com/images/scopebm_sunday.jpg)

* *...Or imposing restrictions.* [Camera Restricta](https://github.com/golanlevin/ExperimentalCapture/blob/master/docs/conceptual-cameras.md#camera-restricta), a 'disobedient' camera designed to take unique photographs. By using data from geotagged photos the camera will refuse to operate in popular places.

### Capturing Places through Mirrors 

![Fly-eye mirror](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/golanlevin/ExperimentalCapture/master/docs/images/fly-eye-mirror.jpg)

* Spherical mirror arrays, which capture a scene from many simultaneous perspectives, [allow for interesting possibilities](http://yuichitaguchi.com/project/AxialCones/), including distortion correction, digital refocusing for artistic depth of field effects in wide-angle scenes, and wide-angle dense depth estimation.

* Images of what someone is looking at can be recovered from reflections in their eyes. See: Ko Nishino et al., ["Corneal Imaging System: Environment from Eyes". ](http://www1.cs.columbia.edu/CAVE/publications/pdfs/Nishino_IJCV06.pdf)

from Keith Loutit
For 'The Lion City', the idea behind the extension of the tilt shift technique is for focus and distance to be something the viewer can experience. It also doubles to communicate the constant heat and humidity that hits you whenever you leave the comfort of air conditioning in Singapore.

### Long Exposure (Light Painting)

Some spaces are uniquely defined by the objects moving within them, whose paths can be visualized through long exposure techniques.

![Long exposure by Matthew Fang](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/golanlevin/ExperimentalCapture/master/docs/images/long-exposure-matthew-fang.jpg)

* [Terence Chang, long exposure photos of airplane takeoffs](http://www.amusingplanet.com/2011/05/long-exposure-shots-of-airline-takeoffs.html)
* [Long Exposure Photographs of Gold Fireflies in Japan](http://www.thisiscolossal.com/2011/12/stunning-time-lapse-photographs-of-gold-fireflies-in-japan/)

### Spaces from Found/Multi/Crowd-Sourced Imagery

* [Aram Bartholl's *Dust*](http://datenform.de/rhizome2011-dust.html) is a 1:1 scale replica of one of the most played computer game maps in the world: the 3D model of ‘[de_dust](http://counterstrike.wikia.com/wiki/Dust)’ of the first person shooter game ‘Counter Strike’ as a permanent ‘building’ from concrete, making this map accessible as a large scale public sculpture.

* [Michael Kontopoulous, *Horizons*](https://vimeo.com/1609048).
What do all westerns have in common? *The horizon.* This is a video installation in which horizon shots from various Samurai and Spaghetti Western films have been stitched together to form one expanded environment. 

* Moving from the landscape of cinematic imagination to the landscape of banal *documentation*, Jason Salavon has created [image averages of homes-for-sale](http://salavon.com/work/Homes/) from classified advertisements in different metropolitan areas. 

![Jason Salavon's 100 Special Moments](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/golanlevin/ExperimentalCapture/master/docs/images/image-averaging/salavon-homes.jpg)<br />

The use of online databases of tagged images substantially expands our ability to learn about places, as they are seen by multitudes of people. 

![Corinne Vionnet's Photo Opportunities](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/golanlevin/ExperimentalCapture/master/docs/images/image-averaging/corinne-vionnet-photoopportunities.jpg)<br />
In her series "*Photo Opportunities*", artist [Corinne Vionnet](http://www.corinnevionnet.com/-photo-opportunities.html) works to create landscapes generated from *thousands* of tourist photos. She takes efforts to align them first. ([Additional article](http://petapixel.com/2013/10/23/photo-opportunities-interview-artist-corinne-vionnet/)) 

Pep Ventosa is working in a similar way:

![Street Light](http://www.pepventosa.com/users/PV1062/images/PV10622164061.jpg)

* In *The Nine Eyes of Google Street View*, Canadian artist Jon Rafman collects the bizarre and beautiful sights captured by the Google streetview. There's no need to take new photos; one can just find them. [*The 9 Eyes of Google Streetview*](http://9-eyes.com/)<br />![9 Eyes](http://41.media.tumblr.com/b0d508584bb821d8c474e540368502ed/tumblr_n5qb992hN01qzun8oo1_1280.jpg)

* An inverse approach to this is [Paolo Cirio's *Street Ghosts*](http://streetghosts.net/)<br />![Cirio](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-IWLU63QtuHU/U2LuRor-txI/AAAAAAAAD5A/1kN160EoAm8/s1024-Ic42/DSC_0097.jpg)

### 3D Spatio-Temporal Composites

* As James George pointed out last week, Microsoft Research [developed 3D models from thousands of tagged tourist photos](http://phototour.cs.washington.edu/).
* Noah Snavely, [Finding paths through the world's photos](http://phototour.cs.washington.edu/findingpaths/)

* Sometimes the camera is moving relative to the reference frame of gravity, but not to the apparent scene: [Studio Moniker, *Sally*](http://roelwouters.com/sally)
* [Camera shutter speed synchronized with helicopter blade frequency](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxddi8m_mzk)
